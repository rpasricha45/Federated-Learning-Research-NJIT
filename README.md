# Federated-Learning-Research-NJIT

Abstract - Federated Learning is a decentralized Machine Learning approach that foucuses on privacy  and learning in a distributed manner

Research : - Use Federated  Learning  to help predict Grades of students based on attribitutes such as hours studied , past preformance


What is Included in this Repository

- Practical implemenation of Federated Experiments
- ScreenShots of Results
- Examples that provide develpers guidence for Developing thier own Federated Experiments

## Federated Learning Features
1. Handle private student information
2. distributed
3. updates model as students change 

Running the code and other federated examples please look at
